  # BASIC TYPES (STRUCTURES)
  # These types do NOT have a VRS `type` attribute
  # These types are used solely within other definitions.
  # =============================================================================

  Sequence:
    additionalProperties: false
    description: >-
      A character string of residues that represents a biological
      sequence using the conventional sequence order (5’-to-3’ for
      nucleic acid sequences, and amino-to-carboxyl for amino acid
      sequences). IUPAC ambiguity codes are permitted in Sequences.
    type: string
    pattern: '[A-Z*\-]*'

  CURIE:
    additionalProperties: false
    description: >-
      A string that refers to an object uniquely.  The lifetime and
      scope of an id is defined by the sender.

      VRS does not impose any contraints on strings used as ids in
      messages. However, to maximize sharability of data, VRS
      RECOMMENDS that implementations use [W3C Compact URI
      (CURIE)](https://www.w3.org/TR/curie/) syntax.

      String CURIEs are represented as `prefix`:`reference` (W3C
      terminology), but often referred to as `namespace`:`accession`
      or `namespace`:`local id` colloquially.

      VRS also RECOMMENDS that `prefix` be defined in identifiers.org.

      The `reference` component is an unconstrained string.

      A CURIE is a URI.  URIs may *locate* objects (i.e., specify
      where to retrieve them) or *name* objects conceptually.  VRS uses
      CURIEs primarily as a naming mechanism.

      Implementations MAY provide CURIE resolution mechanisms for
      prefixes to make these objects locatable.

      Using internal ids in public messages is strongly discouraged.

  HumanCytoband:

    type: string
    pattern: '^cen|[pq](ter|([1-9][0-9]*(\.[1-9][0-9]*)?))$'
    example: "q22.3"

  IntegerRange:
    description: >-
      A [min,max] inclusive range of integer values. At least one of
      min or max must be specified.  An unspecified value indicates an
      unbounded min or max.  When both min and max are specified, they
      must satisfy min <= max.
