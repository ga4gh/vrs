**Computational Definition**

An expression of a sequence that is derived from repeating a subsequence of an associated :ref:`SequenceLocation`.

**Information Model**

Some ReferenceLengthExpression attributes are inherited from :ref:`SequenceExpression`.

   *  - Field
      - Type
      - Limits
      - Description
   *  - id
      - string
      - 0..1
      - The 'logical' identifier of the Entity in the system of record, e.g. a UUID.  This 'id' is unique within a given system, but may or may not be globally unique outside the system. It is used within a system to reference an object from another.
   *  - label
      - string
      - 0..1
      - A primary name for the entity.
   *  - description
      - string
      - 0..1
      - A free-text description of the Entity.
   *  - alternativeLabels
      - string
      - 0..m
      - Alternative name(s) for the Entity.
   *  - extensions
      - :ref:`Extension`
      - 0..m
      - A list of extensions to the Entity, that allow for capture of information not directly supported by elements defined in the model.
   *  - type
      - string
      - 1..1
      - MUST be "ReferenceLengthExpression"
   *  - length
      - integer | :ref:`Range`
      - 1..1
      - The number of residues in the expressed sequence.
   *  - sequence
      - :ref:`SequenceString`
      - 0..1
      - the literal :ref:`Sequence` encoded by the Reference Length Expression.
   *  - repeatSubunitLength
      - integer
      - 1..1
      - The number of residues in the repeat subunit.
