**Computational Definition**

The `Adjacency` class can represent either the termination of a sequence or the adjoining of the end of a sequence with the beginning of an adjacent sequence, potentially with an intervening linker sequence.

    **Information Model**
    
Some Adjacency attributes are inherited from :ref:`Variation`.

       *  - Field
          - Type
          - Limits
          - Description
       *  - id
          - string
          - 0..1
          - The 'logical' identifier of the entity in the system of record, e.g. a UUID. This 'id' is unique within a given system. The identified entity may have a different 'id' in a different system, or may refer to an 'id' for the shared concept in another system (e.g. a CURIE).
       *  - label
          - string
          - 0..1
          - A primary name for the entity.
       *  - description
          - string
          - 0..1
          - A free-text description of the entity.
       *  - alternativeLabels
          - string
          - 0..m
          - Alternative name(s) for the Entity.
       *  - extensions
          - `Extension </ga4gh/schema/gks-common/1.x/data-types/json/Extension>`_
          - 0..m
          - A list of extensions to the entity. Extensions are not expected to be natively understood, but may be used for pre-negotiated exchange of message attributes between systems.
       *  - digest
          - string
          - 0..1
          - A sha512t24u digest created using the VRS Computed Identifier algorithm.
       *  - expressions
          - `Expression </ga4gh/schema/gks-common/1.x/data-types/json/Expression>`_

          - MUST be "Adjacency".
       *  - adjoinedSequences
          - `IRI </ga4gh/schema/gks-common/1.x/data-types/json/IRI>`_ | :ref:`Location`
          - 2..2
          - The terminal sequence or pair of adjoined sequences that defines in the adjacency.
       *  - linker
          - :ref:`SequenceExpression`
          - 0..1
          - The sequence found between adjoined sequences.
       *  - homology
          - boolean
          - 0..1
          - A flag indicating if coordinate ambiguity in the adjoined sequences is from sequence homology (true) or other uncertainty (false).
