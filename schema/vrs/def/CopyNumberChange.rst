**Computational Definition**

An assessment of the copy number of a :ref:`Location` or a :ref:`Gene` within a system (e.g. genome, cell, etc.) relative to a baseline ploidy.

**Information Model**

Some CopyNumberChange attributes are inherited from :ref:`CopyNumber`.

          - The 'logical' identifier of the entity in the system of record, e.g. a UUID. This 'id' is  unique within a given system. The identified entity may have a different 'id' in a different  system, or may refer to an 'id' for the shared concept in another system (e.g. a CURIE).
