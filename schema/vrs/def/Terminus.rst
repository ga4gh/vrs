    significantly in future releases. Maturity levels are described in

**Computational Definition**

The `Terminus` data class provides a structure for describing the end (terminus) of a molecule. Structurally similar to Adjacency, but used for describing where a molecule terminates (instead of adjoining another molecule).

**Information Model**

Some Terminus attributes are inherited from :ref:`Variation`.

   *  - id
      - string
      - 0..1
      - The 'logical' identifier of the Entity in the system of record, e.g. a UUID.  This 'id' is unique within a given system, but may or may not be globally unique outside the system. It is used within a system to reference an object from another.
   *  - label
      - string
      - 0..1
      - A primary name for the entity.
   *  - description

      - string
      - 0..m
      - Alternative name(s) for the Entity.
   *  - extensions
      - :ref:`Extension`
      - 0..m
      - A list of extensions to the Entity, that allow for capture of information not directly supported by elements defined in the model.
   *  - digest
      - string
      - 0..1
      - A sha512t24u digest created using the VRS Computed Identifier algorithm.
   *  - expressions
