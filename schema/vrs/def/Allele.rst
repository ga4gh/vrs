      - A free-text description of the Entity.
   *  - alternativeLabels
      - string
      - 0..m
      - Alternative name(s) for the Entity.
   *  - extensions
      - :ref:`Extension`
      - 0..m
      - A list of extensions to the Entity, that allow for capture of information not directly supported by elements defined in the model.
