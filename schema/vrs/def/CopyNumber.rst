**Computational Definition**

A measure of the copies of a :ref:`Location` within a system (e.g. genome, cell, etc.)

    **Information Model**
    
Some CopyNumber attributes are inherited from :ref:`Variation`.

          - The 'logical' identifier of the entity in the system of record, e.g. a UUID. This 'id' is unique within a given system. The identified entity may have a different 'id' in a different system, or may refer to an 'id' for the shared concept in another system (e.g. a CURIE).

          - A free-text description of the entity.

          - Alternative name(s) for the Entity.

          - 0..m
          - A list of extensions to the entity. Extensions are not expected to be natively understood, but may be used for pre-negotiated exchange of message attributes between systems.
       *  - digest
          - string
          - 0..1
          - A sha512t24u digest created using the VRS Computed Identifier algorithm.

          - 1..1
          - A location for which the number of systemic copies is described.
