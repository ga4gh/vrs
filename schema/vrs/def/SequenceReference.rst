          - string
          - 0..1
          - The 'logical' identifier of the entity in the system of record, e.g. a UUID. This 'id' is  unique within a given system. The identified entity may have a different 'id' in a different  system, or may refer to an 'id' for the shared concept in another system (e.g. a CURIE).
       *  - label
          - string
          - 0..1
          - A primary label for the entity.
       *  - description
          - string
          - 0..1
          - A free-text description of the entity.

          - A `GA4GH RefGet <http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/refget.html>` identifier for the referenced sequence,  using the sha512t24u digest.
       *  - residueAlphabet
          - string
          - 0..1
          - The interpretation of the character codes referred to by the refget accession, where "aa" specifies an amino acid character set, and "na" specifies a nucleic acid character set.
