  CURIE:
    description: >-
      A `W3C Compact URI <https://www.w3.org/TR/curie/>`_ formatted string.
      A CURIE string has the structure ``prefix``:``reference``, as defined by
      the W3C syntax.

  Sequence:
    description: >-
      A character string of :ref:`Residues <Residue>` that represents a biological
      sequence using the conventional sequence order (5’-to-3’ for
      nucleic acid sequences, and amino-to-carboxyl for amino acid
      sequences). IUPAC ambiguity codes are permitted in Sequences.
