    description: >-
      Entity is the root class of ‘core’ classes model - those that have identifiers and other general 
      metadata like labels, xrefs, urls, descriptions, etc. All core classes descend from and inherit 
      its attributes.
    heritableProperties:
      id:
        type: string
        description: >-
          The 'logical' identifier of the entity in the system of record, e.g. a UUID. This 'id' is 
          unique within a given system. The identified entity may have a different 'id' in a different 
          system, or may refer to an 'id' for the shared concept in another system (e.g. a CURIE).
      label:
        type: string
        description: >-
          A primary label for the entity.
      description:
        type: string
        description: >-
          A free-text description of the entity.

  Extension:
    type: object
    maturity: Alpha
    description: >-
      The Extension class provides VODs with a means to extend descriptions
      with other attributes unique to a content provider. These extensions
      are not expected to be natively understood under VRSATILE, but may be
      used for pre-negotiated exchange of message attributes when needed.
    properties:
      type:
        type: string
        const: Extension
        description: MUST be "Extension".
      name:
        type: string
        description: A name for the Extension
      value:
        type: [ "number", "string", "boolean", "object", "array", "null" ]
        description: Any primitive or structured object
    required: [ "name" ]

  Code:
    maturity: Alpha
    description: >-
      Indicates that the value is taken from a set of controlled strings defined elsewhere.
      Technically, a code is restricted to a string which has at least one character and no leading or 
      trailing whitespace, and where there is no whitespace other than single spaces in the contents.
