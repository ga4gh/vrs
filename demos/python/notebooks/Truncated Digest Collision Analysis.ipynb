On further research, there is a clear explanation: The SHA-2 series of digests (which includes SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512) is defined using 64-bit operations. When an implementation is optimized for 64-bit systems (as used for these timings), the number of cycles is essentially halved when compared to 32-bit systems and digests that use 32-bit operations. SHA-2 digests are indeed much slower than SHA-1 and MD5 on 32-bit systems, but such legacy platforms is not relevant to the Truncated Digest."
