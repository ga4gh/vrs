CisPhasedBlock
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The CisPhasedBlock is a set of Alleles that are found *in-cis*: occurring
on the same physical molecule. The CisPhasedBlock structure is useful for 
representing genetic *Haplotypes*, which are commonly described with respect
to locations on a gene, a set of nearby genes, or other physically proximal
genetic markers that tend to be transmitted together. Unlike haplotypes, the
CisPhasedBlock is not also used to convey information about genetic ancestry.

.. admonition:: New in v2

   In VRS v1, a class with the same computational use as the `CisPhasedBlock`
   was defined and named the `Haplotype` class. This term is not used to describe 
   this concept in v2, as the use of the `Haplotype` name created confusion in the
   community, due to the additional semantics of the term around genetic linkage 
   and ancestry. In practice, implmentations transitioning from v1 to v2 should
   find the `CisPhasedBlock` able to accommodate the same information content
   from v1 `Haplotypes`.
