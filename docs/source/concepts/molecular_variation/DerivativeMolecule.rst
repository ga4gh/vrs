.. admonition:: New in v2
   The DerivativeMolecule class was added in v2 to describe structural variation.

DerivativeMolecule is a data class for describing a derivate molecule represented by
adjoined molecular sequences. This is the structure that can be used to recreate 
genomic rearrangements such as inversions or translocations. It also allows for the
description of intervening sequence content through  

This class is under development. See `#461 <https://github.com/ga4gh/vrs/discussions/461>`_
