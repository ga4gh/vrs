Molecular Variation
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

VRS currently covers many classes of variation that are defined on a contiguous molecule such as single nucleotide
variants (SNVs), multi-nucleotide variants (MNVs), indels, repeats, haplotypes, breakpoints, and sequence
rearrangements that form derivative molecules.

Collectively, these types of variation are called molecular variation.
