Future Plans
!!!!!!!!!!!!

Overview
@@@@@@@@

VRS covers a fundamental subset of data types to represent
variation, thus far predominantly related to the replacement of a
subsequence in a reference sequence. Increasing its applicability will
require supporting more complex types of variation, including:

* genotypes
* structural variation
* mosaicism and chimerism
* categorical variation

   Planned Variation Representation Specfication Schema

   See :ref:`Current schema diagram <vr-schema-diagram>` for legend.

   Existing classes are colored green. Components that are
   undergoing testing and evaluation and are candidates for the next
   release cycle are yellow. Components that are planned but
   still undergoing requirement gathering and initial development are
   colored red.

The following sections provide a preview of planned concepts under way
to address a broader representation of variation.


.. _planned-locations:

Intervals and Locations
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

VRS uses :ref:`Location` subclasses to define where variation occurs.
The schema is designed to be extensible to new kinds of Intervals and
Locations in order to support, for example, fuzzy coordinates or
feature-based locations.

ComplexInterval
###############

Representation of complex coordinates based on relative locations or
offsets from a known location. Examples include "left of" a given
position and intronic positions measured from intron-exon junctions.

**Computational definition**

Under development.

**Information model**

Under development.


.. _planned-variation:

Variation Classes
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Additional :ref:`Variation` concepts that are being planned for future
consideration in the specification. See :ref:`Variation` for more
information.


Structural Variation
####################

.. note:: This concept is being refined. Please comment at https://github.com/ga4gh/vrs/issues/103

The aberrant joining of two segments of DNA that are not typically
contiguous.  In the context of joining two distinct coding sequences,
translocations result in a gene fusion, which is also covered by this
VRS definition.

**Computational definition**

A joining of two sequences is defined by two :ref:`Location` objects
and an indication of the join "pattern" (advice needed on conventional
terminology, if any).

**Information model**

Under consideration. See https://github.com/ga4gh/vrs/issues/28.

**Examples**

t(9;22)(q34;q11) in BCR-ABL


.. _genotype:

Genotype
########

The genetic state of an organism, whether complete (defined over the
whole genome) or incomplete (defined over a subset of the genome).

**Computational definition**

A list of Haplotypes.

**Information model**

.. list-table::
   :class: reece-wrap
   :header-rows: 1
   :align: left
   :widths: auto

   * - Field
     - Type
     - Limits
     - Description
   * - _id
     - :ref:`CURIE`
     - 0..1
     - Variation Id; MUST be unique within document
   * - type
     - string
     - 1..1
     - Variation type; MUST be set to '**Genotype**'
   * - completeness
     - enum
     - 1..1
     - Declaration of completeness of the Haplotype definition.
       Values are:

       * UNKNOWN: Other Haplotypes may exist.
       * PARTIAL: Other Haplotypes exist but are unspecified.
       * COMPLETE: The Genotype declares a complete set of Haplotypes.

   * - members
     - :ref:`Haplotype`\[] or :ref:`CURIE`\[]
     - 0..*
     - List of Haplotypes or Haplotype identifiers; length MUST agree
       with ploidy of genomic region


**Implementation guidance**

* Haplotypes in a Genotype MAY occur at different locations or on
  different reference sequences. For example, an individual may have
  haplotypes on two population-specific references.
* Haplotypes in a Genotype MAY contain differing numbers of Alleles or
  Alleles at different Locations.

**Notes**

* The term "genotype" has two, related definitions in common use. The
  narrower definition is a set of alleles observed at a single
  location and with a ploidy of two, such as a pair of single residue
  variants on an autosome. The broader, generalized definition is a
  set of alleles at multiple locations and/or with ploidy other than
  two.The VRS Genotype entity is based on this broader definition.
* The term "diplotype" is often used to refer to two haplotypes. The
  VRS Genotype entity subsumes the conventional definition of
  diplotype. Therefore, the VRS model does not include an explicit
  entity for diplotypes. See :ref:`this note
  <genotypes-represent-haplotypes-with-arbitrary-ploidy>` for a
  discussion.
* The VRS model makes no assumptions about ploidy of an organism or
  individual. The number of Haplotypes in a Genotype is the observed
  ploidy of the individual.
* In diploid organisms, there are typically two instances of each
  autosomal chromosome, and therefore two instances of sequence at a
  particular location. Thus, Genotypes will often list two
  Haplotypes. In the case of haploid chromosomes or
  haploinsufficiency, the Genotype consists of a single Haplotype.
* A consequence of the computational definition is that Haplotypes at
  overlapping or adjacent intervals MUST NOT be included in the same
  Genotype. However, two or more Alleles MAY always be rewritten as an
  equivalent Allele with a common sequence and interval context.
* The rationale for permitting Genotypes with Haplotypes defined on
  different reference sequences is to enable the accurate
  representation of segments of DNA with the most appropriate
  population-specific reference sequence.

.. _genotypes-represent-haplotypes-with-arbitrary-ploidy:

.. note:: Genotypes represent Haplotypes with arbitrary ploidy
     The VRS defines Haplotypes as a list of Alleles, and Genotypes as
     a list of Haplotypes. In essence, Haplotypes and Genotypes represent
     two distinct dimensions of containment: Haplotypes represent the "in
     phase" relationship of Alleles while Genotypes represents sets of
     Haplotypes of arbitrary ploidy.

     There are two important consequences of these definitions: There is no
     single-location Genotype. Users of SNP data will be familiar with
     representations like rs7412 C/C, which indicates the diploid state at
     a position. In the VRS, this is merely a special case of a
     Genotype with two Haplotypes, each of which is defined with only one
     Allele (the same Allele in this case).  The VRS does not define a
     diplotype type. A diplotype is a special case of a VRS Genotype
     with exactly two Haplotypes. In practice, software data types that
     assume a ploidy of 2 make it very difficult to represent haploid
     states, copy number loss, and copy number gain, all of which occur
     when representing human data. In addition, assuming ploidy=2 makes
     software incompatible with organisms with other ploidy. The VRS
     makes no assumptions about "normal" ploidy.

     In other words, the VRS does not represent single-position
     Genotypes or diplotypes because both concepts are subsumed by the
     Allele, Haplotype, and Genotypes entities.

Categorical Variation
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Some variations are defined by categorical concepts, rather than specific
locations and states. These variations go by many terms, including
*categorical variants*, *bucket variants*, *container variants*, or
*variant classes*. These forms of variation are not described by any
broadly-recognized variation format, but modeling them is a key requirement
for the representation of aggregate variation descriptions as commonly
found in biomedical literature. Our future work will focus on the formal
specification for representing these variations with sets of rules, which
we currently call *Categorical Variation*.
