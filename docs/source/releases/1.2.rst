  * The first manuscript for VRS has been submitted. Please cite
    https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.15.426843v1.
  * Want to get involved? See the `VRS Appendix
    <https://vrs.ga4gh.org/en/stable/appendices/index.html>`_ for the
    many ways that you can inform and contribute to VRS.

Important
#########

  * :ref:`SimpleInterval and SequenceState are deprecated
    <deprecations>`. They will be removed in VRS 2.0.

Major Changes
#############

  * New classification of variation types.

    * :ref:`MolecularVariation` refers to variation within or of a
      contiguous molecular
    * :ref:`SystemicVariation` refers to variation in the context of a
      system, such as a genome, sample, or homologous chromosomes
    * :ref:`UtilityVariation` classes provide useful representations
      for certain technical operations

  * New :ref:`SequenceExpressions <SequenceExpression>` subclasses
    replace SequenceState.  Subtypes are:
    
    * :ref:`DerivedSequenceExpression`, which representations sequence
      notionally derived from a SequenceLocation
    * :ref:`RepeatedSequenceExpression`, which represents contiguous
      repeats of a sequence
    * :ref:`LiteralSequenceExpression`, which
      wraps a :ref:`Sequence` and provides data structure parity with
      other SequenceExpressions
  * :ref:`CopyNumber`, a form of SystemicVariation, represents the
    copies of a molecule within a genome, and can be used to express
    concepts such as amplification and copy loss.
  * :ref:`Gene` enables reference to an external definition of a gene,
    particularly for useas a subject of copy number expressions.
  * :ref:`DefiniteRange` and :ref:`IndefiniteRange` represent bounded
    and half-bounded ranges respectively. A new :ref:`Number` type
    wraps integers so that some attributes may assume values of any of
    these three types.


Minor Changes
#############

  * Sequence strings are now formally defined by a :ref:`Sequence`
    type, which is fundamentally also a string.  This change aids
    documentation but has no technical impact.
